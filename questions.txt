1)write a program that takes 2 numbers from user and prints a smallest possible number which when added to sum of these two number will gives a prime number.
that is if user entered 5 and 7 then program should print 1 because 5+7+1=13 where 13 is prime.
(3 points)

2)Take a number from user and swap all digits at even places with the digit at next odd place. that is if a number is 354286 then the new number is 532468.
(3 points)

3)print the following pattern on the screen using loops

        **********
        ****  ****
        ***    ***
        **      **
        *        *
        **      **
        ***    ***
        ****  ****
        **********

4)Given a array of positive integer arrange them in such a manner such that the largest number is present at the middle and number decreases as the index of array moves towards the edges
for example
      if array is -> 2 7 20 4 34 5 8 42 57 39 46
      the resultant array should be-> 2 5 8 34 42 57 46 39 20 7 4   
                                      < < < <  <  <>  >  >  > > >

5)you are given an array of positive numbers of size N.
  find the total number of pairs(a,b) you can form such that a<b
  (3 points)

6)given a array of int of size N where N<32. Print a number whose i-th bit(in binary representation) is same as i-th bit of i-th element of array.
Suppose there is an array of 3 numbers whose binary representation is
00010101, 10101010, 11100011 then

  0  0  0  1  0  1  0 *1*
  1  0  1  0  1  0 *1* 0
+ 1  1  1  0  0 *0* 1  1
-------------------
  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1
 
Final number in binary is 00000011. That is 3. So you have to print 3 on screen in this case.

7)write a program that reads a text file and calculates sum of length of all words that contains more than 2 vowels.
For Example- "Hello world! this is a file reading program "
  the words are-                 Hello+file+reading+program
  so, sum of length of words is-   5  +  4 +   7   +   7    = 23
(3 points)

8)given a alphanumeric string made of digits and character. Find the sum of all the digits in the string. 
(3 points)

9)Given two strings, write a program that efficiently finds the longest common subsequence. That is, if there are two strings "school" and "swimming pool" then the longest common subsequence/substring is "ool"
(3 points)

10)Given a Set of N elements in the form of array of size N. Print power set of this set.
(5 points)

11)Print all the possible permutation of a given set of elements(in the form of array of size N)
(4 points)

12)Write a File Manager Program that maintains a list of files stored on harddisk by the program.
Program provides the following option to user-
      *write new files to harddisk,
      *delete old files on hardisk,
      *modify old files on harddisk,
      *print content of a file on harddisk,
      *prints the list of all files present on harddisk,
      *print the size of particular file, 
      *find and replace a particular word in a file
      *exit
Create a menu for providing above options and program keeps on running until user chooses exit.
