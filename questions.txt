1)write a program that takes 2 numbers from user and prints a smallest number which when added to sum of these two number gives a prime number.
that is if user entered 5 and 7 then program should print 1 because 5+7+1=13 where 13 is prime.

2)Take a number from user and swap all digits at even places with the digit at next odd place. that is if a number is 354286 then the new number is 532468.

3)print the following pattern on the screen using loops

        **********
        ****  ****
        ***    ***
        **      **
        *        *
        **      **
        ***    ***
        ****  ****
        **********

4)Given a array of positive integer arrange them in such a manner such that the largest number is present at the middle and number decreases as the index of array moves towards the edges
for example
      if array is -> 2 7 20 4 34 5 8 42 57 39 46
      the resultant array should be-> 2 5 8 34 42 57 46 39 20 7 4          

5)you are given an array of positive numbers of size N.
  find the total number of pairs(a,b) you can form such that a<b

6)given a array of int of size N where N<32. Print a number whose i-th bit(in binary representation) is same as i-th bit of i-th element of array.
 
7)write a program that reads a text file and calculates sum of length of all words that contains more than 2 vowels.
For Example- "Hello world! this is a file reading program "
  the words are-                 Hello+file+reading+program
  so, sum of length of words is-   5  +  4 +   7   +   7    = 23

8)given a alphanumeric string made of digits and character. Find the sum of all the digits in the string

9)Given two strings, write a program that efficiently finds the longest common subsequence.

10)Given a Set of N elements in the form of array of size N. Print power set of this set.

11)Print all the possible permutation of a given set of elements(in the form of array of size N)

12)Write a File Manager Program that maintains a list of files stored on harddisk by the program.
Program provides the following option to user-
      *write new files to harddisk,
      *delete old files on hardisk,
      *modify old files on harddisk,
      *print content of a file on harddisk,
      *prints the list of all files present on harddisk,
      *print the size of particular file, 
      *find and replace a particular word in a file
      *exit
Create a menu for providing above options and program keeps on running until user chooses exit.
